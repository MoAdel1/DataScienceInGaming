# Data scienceÂ in gaming industry

## Introduction

This repository is my attempt to show why I am a good fit for the senior data scientist position by:

- Discussing possible applications using data science in Kolibri games
- Give a demo for one of the problems that can be solved using machine learning with real life example data

While Koilbri games may already be working on some or all of the proposed applications, the purpose here is to demonstrate my own:

- Research skills
- Creativity
- Data science/Machine learning skills
- Software development skills
- Huge interest in working in Kolibri games as a new and exciting challenge for me

I hope this would give you the opportunity to know me better than a cover letter or an assigned task.

## Data sources

Usually we can split the data sources in gaming industry into three sources:

- User/player data (play logs, purchases, events, etc...)
- Performance data (game logs, crash down data, etc...)
- Macro data (play store stats, reviews)

Different data sources are stored in the proper databases (structured/unstructured), based on the datatype. The data is passed through data extraction and feature engineering pipelines before being used in any of the data science dependent applications.

## Applications

It is safe to assume that applications dependent on data may fall into one of the two categories:

- Analytical applications: gives insights into the business 
- Actionable applications: gives recommendations and actions to act upon
